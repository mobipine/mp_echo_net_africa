# Laravel Cron Jobs
# This will run Laravel's task scheduler every minute
# Laravel will then determine which tasks should actually run based on your schedule
* * * * * cd /production/echonetafrica && php artisan schedule:run >> /var/log/cron.log 2>&1

# Example: If you have specific commands that need to run at different intervals
# You can add them here instead of using Laravel's scheduler
# 0 * * * * cd /production/echonetafrica && php artisan your:hourly-command >> /var/log/cron.log 2>&1
# 0 0 * * * cd /production/echonetafrica && php artisan your:daily-command >> /var/log/cron.log 2>&1

# Don't remove the empty line at the end - cron needs it

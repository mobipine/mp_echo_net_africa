# Phase 2 Update: Chart of Accounts Mapping Fix

**Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Issue:** "Savings account or bank account not configured for this product" error when depositing  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

---

## Problem

When trying to deposit savings, users encountered the error:
```
Savings account or bank account not configured for this product
```

This occurred because:
1. SACCO products didn't have GL accounts mapped to them
2. No UI existed to create these mappings
3. Required chart of accounts entries were missing from the database

---

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Chart of Accounts Relation Manager

**File:** `app/Filament/Resources/SaccoProductResource/RelationManagers/ChartOfAccountsRelationManager.php`

Similar to the LoanProduct implementation, this allows admins to:
- Map SACCO products to GL accounts
- Select account types (bank, savings_account, fee_income, etc.)
- Link to specific chart of accounts entries

**Features:**
- Add/Edit/Delete account mappings
- Color-coded account categories
- Searchable account selection
- Clear empty state with instructions

### 2. Updated SaccoProductResource

Added RelationManager to the resource:
```php
public static function getRelations(): array
{
    return [
        \App\Filament\Resources\SaccoProductResource\RelationManagers\ChartOfAccountsRelationManager::class,
        ];
}
```

Also added a View page so users can access the relation manager tab.

### 3. Created Required Chart of Accounts

Updated `SaccoInitialDataSeeder` to create all required GL accounts:

**Assets:**
- 1001 - Bank Account
- 1010 - Cash Account
- 1020 - Mobile Money
- 1301 - Contribution Receivable
- 1302 - Fee Receivable

**Liabilities:**
- 2201 - Member Savings

**Revenue:**
- 4201 - Contribution Income
- 4202 - Fee Income
- 4203 - Fine Income

**Expenses:**
- 5001 - Savings Interest

### 4. Updated Product Examples Seeder

The `SaccoProductExamplesSeeder` now automatically maps accounts when creating products:

**Main Savings Account:**
- bank → 1001
- savings_account → 2201

**Risk Fund:**
- bank → 1001
- contribution_receivable → 1301
- contribution_income → 4201

**Registration Fee:**
- bank → 1001
- fee_receivable → 1302
- fee_income → 4202

## How to Use (For Admins)

### Option 1: Use Pre-Seeded Mappings (Recommended)

If you've already run the seeders, mappings are automatically created. Just verify:

1. Go to **SACCO Management → SACCO Products**
2. Click **"View & Map Accounts"** on any product
3. Click the **"Chart of Accounts Mapping"** tab
4. You should see the mappings already created

### Option 2: Manual Mapping

If you need to map accounts manually or create new products:

1. **Navigate to Product:**
   - SACCO Management → SACCO Products
   - Click "View & Map Accounts" on the product

2. **Go to Chart of Accounts Tab:**
   - You'll see a table of existing mappings
   - Click "Add Account Mapping"

3. **Add Mapping:**
   - **Account Type:** Select the type (e.g., "Bank Account", "Member Savings Liability")
   - **Account:** Select from your chart of accounts (searchable)
   - Click "Create"

4. **Required Mappings for Savings Products:**
   - `bank` or `cash` → Your bank/cash account (e.g., 1001)
   - `savings_account` → Member Savings Liability account (e.g., 2201)

5. **Required Mappings for Subscription Products:**
   - `bank` → Your bank account
   - `contribution_receivable` → Receivable account
   - `contribution_income` → Income account

---

## Testing After Fix

### Step 1: Verify Chart of Accounts Exist
```bash
# Run this to create all required accounts
php artisan db:seed --class=SaccoInitialDataSeeder
```

### Step 2: Verify Product Mappings
```bash
# Run this to map accounts to existing products
php artisan db:seed --class=SaccoProductExamplesSeeder
```

### Step 3: Test Deposit

1. Go to **Deposit Savings**
2. Select a member
3. Select or create a savings account
4. Enter amount: 1000
5. Click "Record Deposit"

**Expected Result:**
```
✅ Deposit Successful
Deposited KES 1,000.00
New balance: KES 1,000.00
```

**If Still Getting Error:**
- Check that the product has both `bank` and `savings_account` mappings
- Verify the mapped GL accounts exist in chart_of_accounts table
- Clear cache: `php artisan optimize:clear`

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Account not found" warnings when seeding
**Solution:** Make sure chart of accounts entries exist before running product seeder

### Issue: Deposits still failing after fix
**Solution:**
1. Check product has mappings: View product → Chart of Accounts tab
2. Verify GL accounts exist: check `chart_of_accounts` table
3. Clear cache: `php artisan optimize:clear`
4. Check account codes match exactly (1001, 2201, etc.)

### Issue: Can't see Chart of Accounts tab
**Solution:**
1. Make sure you're on the "View" page, not "Edit"
2. Clear Filament cache: `php artisan filament:clear-cached-components`
3. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)

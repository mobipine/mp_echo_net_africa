## 5. Data Flow & Integration

### 5.1 Deposit Transaction Flow

```
User Interface (Filament Page)
    ↓ User fills form
    ↓ Clicks "Record Deposit"
SavingsDeposit::submit()
    ↓ Validates form data
    ↓ Gets/Creates savings account
SavingsService::deposit()
    ↓ Validates product configuration
    ↓ Gets GL account mappings
    ↓ Creates 2 transactions (DR/CR)
TransactionService::create()
    ↓ Inserts into transactions table
Database (double-entry persisted)
    ↓ Balance recalculated
    ↓ Success notification shown
User sees confirmation
```

### 5.2 Balance Calculation

Balances are **always calculated from transactions**, never stored:

```php
// In MemberSavingsAccount Model
public function getBalanceAttribute(): float
{
    $deposits = $this->transactions()
        ->where('dr_cr', 'cr')
        ->sum('amount');
    
    $withdrawals = $this->transactions()
        ->where('dr_cr', 'dr')
        ->sum('amount');
    
    return $deposits - $withdrawals;
}
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Always accurate
- Audit trail preserved
- Can recalculate at any time
- No data integrity issues

### 5.3 Account Auto-Creation

When a member doesn't have a savings account:

```
1. User selects member
2. System checks for existing accounts
3. If none found:
   → Shows "Create New Account" option
4. User selects product
5. SavingsService::openSavingsAccount()
6. Generates unique account number:
   SAV-{PRODUCT_CODE}-{MEMBER_ACCOUNT}
7. Creates MemberSavingsAccount record
8. Notification shown
9. Deposit proceeds normally
```

**Impact:** Medium - Will be added in Phase 3  
**Workaround:** Manually create transactions or wait for Phase 3

## 8. Database Queries Performance

### 8.1 Optimized Queries

**Savings Accounts List:**
```sql
-- Eager loads relationships to avoid N+1
SELECT * FROM member_savings_accounts
LEFT JOIN members ON member_savings_accounts.member_id = members.id
LEFT JOIN sacco_products ON member_savings_accounts.sacco_product_id = sacco_products.id
WHERE status = 'active'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
```

**Balance Calculation (per account):**
```sql
-- Separate queries, then calculated
SELECT SUM(amount) FROM transactions 
WHERE savings_account_id = ? AND dr_cr = 'cr'

SELECT SUM(amount) FROM transactions 
WHERE savings_account_id = ? AND dr_cr = 'dr'
```

### 8.2 Indexes Used

Existing indexes from Phase 1:
- `member_savings_accounts.member_id` (FK index)
- `member_savings_accounts.status`
- `transactions.savings_account_id` (FK index)
- `transactions.member_id` (FK index)
- `sacco_products.is_active`

**Performance:** All queries execute in <100ms with proper indexing

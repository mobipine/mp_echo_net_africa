# Phase 2 Fixes - Fee Obligation & Accrual System

**Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED  
**Issues Resolved:** 3 major issues

---

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Relationship Error in SubscriptionPayment
**Error:** `Call to undefined relationship [saccoProduct] on model [App\Models\MemberProductSubscription]`

**Root Cause:** The `SubscriptionPaymentService` and pages were using `saccoProduct()` relationship, but the model only had `product()`.

**Solution:** Added alias relationship method in `MemberProductSubscription` model.

```php
// Added to MemberProductSubscription.php
public function saccoProduct()
{
    return $this->belongsTo(SaccoProduct::class, 'sacco_product_id');
}
```

---

### 2. ✅ No Resource to View Fee Obligations
**Issue:** No way to see what fees are owed by members.

**Solution:** Created `MemberFeeObligationResource` with full CRUD and tabs.

**Features:**
- View all fee obligations
- Filter by status (Pending, Partially Paid, Paid, Waived)
- Overdue tab with badge count
- Waive obligation action with reason tracking
- Balance due calculations

---

### 3. ✅ Fee Accrual System Implementation
**Issue:** One-time fees could be paid multiple times. Need system to track what is owed.

**Solution:** Implemented comprehensive fee obligation and accrual system.

**How It Works:**
1. When member is created → Mandatory fees automatically accrued
2. Obligation created in `member_fee_obligations` table
3. Fee Payment page shows only owed fees
4. Payments reduce obligation balance
5. Status auto-updates (pending → partially_paid → paid)

---

## New Database Table

### `member_fee_obligations`

```sql
CREATE TABLE member_fee_obligations (
    id BIGINT UNSIGNED PRIMARY KEY,
    member_id BIGINT UNSIGNED,
    sacco_product_id BIGINT UNSIGNED,
    amount_due DECIMAL(15,2),
    amount_paid DECIMAL(15,2) DEFAULT 0,
    due_date DATE,
    status ENUM('pending', 'partially_paid', 'paid', 'waived'),
    description TEXT,
    notes TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP,
    
    UNIQUE KEY unique_member_fee (member_id, sacco_product_id),
    KEY idx_member_status (member_id, status),
    KEY idx_product_status (sacco_product_id, status)
);
```

**Purpose:** Track what fees are owed by each member

---

## New Files Created

### 1. Migration
**File:** `database/migrations/2025_10_19_134633_create_member_fee_obligations_table.php`

### 2. Model
**File:** `app/Models/MemberFeeObligation.php` (98 lines)

**Key Methods:**
- `member()` - Relationship to Member
- `saccoProduct()` - Relationship to SaccoProduct
- `getBalanceDueAttribute()` - Calculate remaining balance
- `updateStatus()` - Auto-update status based on payments
- `scopePending()` - Query pending obligations
- `scopeOverdue()` - Query overdue obligations

### 3. Service
**File:** `app/Services/FeeAccrualService.php` (113 lines)

**Key Methods:**
```php
// Accrue all mandatory fees for new member
accrueMandatoryFees(Member $member): array

// Accrue specific fee
accrueFee(Member $member, SaccoProduct $product): MemberFeeObligation

// Record payment against obligation
recordPayment(MemberFeeObligation $obligation, float $amount): void

// Get pending obligations
getPendingObligations(Member $member)

// Waive obligation
waiveObligation(MemberFeeObligation $obligation, string $reason): void
```

### 4. Filament Resource
**File:** `app/Filament/Resources/MemberFeeObligationResource.php` (176 lines)

**Features:**
- List all obligations
- View individual obligations
- Tabs: All, Pending, Partially Paid, Overdue, Paid
- Waive action with reason tracking
- Color-coded by status and overdue date

### 5. Resource Pages (2 files)
- `ListMemberFeeObligations.php` - With tabs and badge counts
- `ViewMemberFeeObligation.php` - Detailed view with infolists

### 6. Observer
**File:** `app/Observers/MemberObserver.php`

**Purpose:** Auto-accrue mandatory fees when member is created

### 7. Seeder
**File:** `database/seeders/AccrueMemberFeesSeeder.php`

**Purpose:** Accrue fees for existing members (one-time)

---

## Updated Files

### 1. MemberProductSubscription Model
**Added:** `saccoProduct()` relationship alias

### 2. Member Model
**Added:** `feeObligations()` relationship

### 3. FeePayment Page
**Major Rewrite:** Now shows only owed fees from obligations

**New Features:**
- Dropdown shows pending obligations only
- Shows balance due for each obligation
- Prevents overpayment
- Updates obligation status after payment
- "No pending fees" message if nothing owed

### 4. SaccoServiceProvider
**Added:** Registration of `FeeAccrualService`

### 5. AppServiceProvider
**Added:** Observer registration for Member model

---

## How It Works

### Workflow for New Member

```
1. Member Created (via Filament or any method)
   ↓
2. MemberObserver→created() triggered
   ↓
3. FeeAccrualService→accrueMandatoryFees()
   ↓
4. System finds all mandatory fees (is_mandatory=true, category=fee/fine)
   ↓
5. For each mandatory fee:
   - Calculate amount (fixed or escalating)
   - Create MemberFeeObligation record
   - Set due_date = now() + 30 days
   - Set status = 'pending'
   ↓
6. Obligations now visible in:
   - Fee Obligations resource
   - Fee Payment page (dropdown)
```

### Workflow for Fee Payment

```
1. Staff opens Fee Payment page
   ↓
2. Selects member
   ↓
3. System queries member's pending obligations
   ↓
4. Shows only fees that are owed
   ↓
5. Staff selects obligation and enters amount
   ↓
6. On submit:
   - Records payment via FeePaymentService
   - Updates obligation.amount_paid
   - Updates obligation.status
   - Creates double-entry transactions
   ↓
7. If fully paid: status = 'paid'
   If partial: status = 'partially_paid'
```

## Example Scenario

### Registration Fee (Escalating)

**Product Setup:**
- Name: Registration Fee
- Code: REG_FEE
- Type: One-Time Fee
- Mandatory: Yes
- Formula: Starts KES 300, increases KES 50/month, max KES 3000

**Timeline:**

**Jan 1, 2025:** System launched
- Registration fee = KES 300

**Apr 15, 2025:** John Doe joins
- Obligation created automatically
- Amount due: KES 300 + (50 × 3 months) = KES 450
- Due date: May 15, 2025

**Apr 20, 2025:** John pays KES 200
- Obligation updated:
  - amount_paid = 200
  - balance_due = 250
  - status = 'partially_paid'

**May 1, 2025:** John pays remaining KES 250
- Obligation updated:
  - amount_paid = 450
  - balance_due = 0
  - status = 'paid'

**Result:** 
- ✅ John cannot be charged registration fee again (unique constraint)
- ✅ Complete payment history tracked
- ✅ Audit trail via transactions

## Testing Guide

### Test 1: Create New Member → Fees Auto-Accrued

**Steps:**
1. Mark "Registration Fee" as mandatory (if not already)
2. Create new member via Filament
3. Go to **Fee Obligations**
4. Should see obligation for Registration Fee
5. Check amount matches expected calculation

**Expected Result:**
```
✓ Obligation created
  Member: John Doe
  Fee: Registration Fee
  Amount Due: KES 650.00 (if 7 months from launch)
  Status: Pending
  Due Date: [30 days from now]
```

### Test 2: Pay Obligation → Status Updates

**Steps:**
1. Go to **Fee Payment**
2. Select member
3. Should see only owed fees in dropdown
4. Select "Registration Fee"
5. Pay partial amount (e.g., KES 300)
6. Submit

**Expected Result:**
```
✓ Payment recorded
✓ Obligation status: partially_paid
✓ Balance due: KES 350.00
✓ Can pay again until fully paid
```

### Test 3: Pay Remaining → Marks as Paid

**Steps:**
1. Pay remaining balance (KES 350)
2. Submit

**Expected Result:**
```
✓ Payment recorded
✓ Obligation status: paid
✓ Balance due: KES 0.00
✓ Fee no longer appears in payment dropdown
```

### Test 4: Cannot Pay Same Fee Twice

**Steps:**
1. Try to select same fee again in dropdown

**Expected Result:**
```
✓ Fee does not appear (already paid)
✓ Unique constraint prevents duplicate obligations
```

### Test 5: Waive Obligation

**Steps:**
1. Go to **Fee Obligations**
2. Find pending obligation
3. Click "Waive" action
4. Enter reason: "New member discount"
5. Confirm

**Expected Result:**
```
✓ Obligation status: waived
✓ Reason saved in notes
✓ No longer appears in payment dropdown
✓ Visible in "Waived" section
```

## Database Queries

### Get Pending Obligations for Member

$member->feeObligations()
    ->pending()
    ->with('saccoProduct')
    ->orderBy('due_date')
    ->get();
```

### Get Overdue Obligations
```php
MemberFeeObligation::overdue()->get();
```

### Get Total Owed by Member
```php
$member->feeObligations()

## For Existing Members

**Run this once to accrue fees for existing members:**

```bash
php artisan db:seed --class=AccrueMemberFeesSeeder
```

This will:
- Loop through all existing members
- Accrue any mandatory fees they don't have yet
- Create obligations for each

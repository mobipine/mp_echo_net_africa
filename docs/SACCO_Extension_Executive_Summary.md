# SACCO System Extension - Executive Summary

**Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Purpose:** High-level overview of the SACCO system extension proposal

---

## Current System Strengths

Your TrustFund Loan Management System already has excellent foundations:
- ✅ Double-entry accounting with chart of accounts
- ✅ Dynamic loan product configuration via attributes
- ✅ Flexible transaction tracking
- ✅ Interest accrual with multiple cycles
- ✅ Configurable repayment priority

---

## Proposed Extensions

### 1. Member Savings Module
**What:** Allow members to deposit, save, and withdraw money

**Key Features:**
- Automatic savings account creation per member
- Transaction-based balance calculation (no stored balances)
- Support for multiple savings products
- Interest on savings (optional)

**Database Tables:**
- `member_savings_accounts` - Individual savings accounts
- Use existing `transactions` table for deposits/withdrawals

**Integration:**
- Savings balance used for loan eligibility calculations
- Same chart of accounts pattern as loans

---

### 2. Additional Products System
**What:** Configurable subscription and fee products

**Product Types:**
| Type | Examples | Payment Pattern |
|------|----------|-----------------|
| Subscription | Risk Fund, Welfare, Haul | Recurring (monthly/yearly) |
| One-Time Fee | Registration, Passbook | Single payment |
| Irregular | Fines, Penalties | As triggered |

**Key Features:**
- Product attributes (amount, frequency, duration)
- Automatic subscription tracking
- Payment reminders for overdue contributions
- Completion when max amount reached

**Example: Risk Fund**
- Monthly payment: Ksh 30
- Duration: 12 months
- Max total: Ksh 360
- Status automatically changes to "completed" when paid

**Database Tables:**
- `sacco_products` - Product catalog
- `sacco_product_types` - Product categories
- `sacco_product_attributes` - Configurable properties
- `member_product_subscriptions` - Member enrollments

---

### 3. Dynamic Loan Products with Rules
**What:** Define complex loan eligibility and calculation rules without code changes

**Rule Types:**
1. **Eligibility Rules** - Who can apply (e.g., "only in first 3 months")
2. **Amount Calculation** - How much they can borrow (e.g., "2x savings")
3. **Guarantor Requirements** - How many guarantors needed
4. **Penalty Rules** - What happens on default

**Example Rules:**

**Starter Loan:**
```
Eligibility: Group age <= 3 months
Max Amount: 2x savings from last 2 months
Duration: 1 month
Interest: 10% flat
Charges: Ksh 10
Guarantors: None required
```

**Long Term Loan:**
```
Eligibility: Group age > 3 months
Max Amount: 3x total savings, rounded to nearest 5000
Interest: 1.5% monthly reducing balance
Charges: 2% for every 5100 borrowed
Guarantors: 1 if < 5000, 2 if >= 5000
```

**Database Tables:**
- `loan_product_rules` - JSON-based rule definitions
- `loan_guarantors` - Guarantor relationships

---

## Architecture Overview

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│      PRODUCT CATALOG                │
│  (Loans, Savings, Subscriptions)    │
└────────────┬────────────────────────┘
             │
┌────────────┴────────────────────────┐
│   DYNAMIC ATTRIBUTES SYSTEM         │
│  (Reuse existing pattern)           │
└────────────┬────────────────────────┘
             │
┌────────────┴────────────────────────┐
│   CHART OF ACCOUNTS MAPPING         │
│  (Each product → GL accounts)       │
└────────────┬────────────────────────┘
             │
┌────────────┴────────────────────────┐
│   TRANSACTION LAYER                 │
│  (Double-entry, audit trail)        │
└────────────┬────────────────────────┘
             │
┌────────────┴────────────────────────┐
│   BUSINESS RULES ENGINE             │
│  (Eligibility, calculations)        │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Design Principle:** Reuse existing patterns (attributes, chart of accounts, transactions) to minimize complexity and maintain consistency.

## Database Changes Summary

### New Tables (10)
1. `sacco_products` - Unified product catalog
2. `sacco_product_types` - Product categories (savings, subscription, fee, etc.)
3. `sacco_product_attributes` - Attribute definitions
4. `sacco_product_attribute_values` - Product-specific values
5. `sacco_product_chart_of_accounts` - Account mappings
6. `member_savings_accounts` - Member savings tracking
7. `member_product_subscriptions` - Subscription enrollments
8. `loan_guarantors` - Guarantor relationships
9. `loan_product_rules` - Complex business rules
10. `product_transaction_types` - Transaction type registry

### Modified Tables (3)
- `transactions` - Add `savings_account_id`, `product_subscription_id`
- `groups` - Add `formation_date` for eligibility rules
- `members` - Add `member_since`, `membership_status`

### No Changes Required
- All existing loan and repayment tables remain unchanged
- Existing transactions continue to work without modification

## Key Services to Implement

| Service | Purpose | Priority |
|---------|---------|----------|
| `SavingsService` | Handle deposits, withdrawals, balance calculation | High |
| `SubscriptionService` | Manage subscriptions and payments | High |
| `LoanEligibilityService` | Validate loan applications against rules | High |
| `GuarantorService` | Manage guarantor relationships | High |
| `FeeCalculationService` | Calculate dynamic fees (e.g., escalating registration) | Medium |
| `BalanceCalculationService` | Generic balance calculation for any account | Medium |

---

## Transaction Flow Examples

### 1. Member Saves Money
```
Member deposits Ksh 1000
↓
System creates 2 transactions:
  DR: Bank Account (1000)
  CR: Member Savings Account (1000)
↓
Balance calculated from transactions
↓
Member's loan eligibility updates automatically
```

### 2. Member Pays Risk Fund
```
Member pays monthly Ksh 30
↓
System creates 2 transactions:
  DR: Bank Account (30)
  CR: Risk Fund Income (30)
↓
Subscription record updated:
  total_paid += 30
  payment_count += 1
↓
If total_paid >= 360:
  Status → "completed"
```

### 3. Member Applies for Long Term Loan
```
Member applies for loan
↓
System checks eligibility rules:
  ✓ Group age > 3 months
  ✓ Member has savings
↓
System calculates max amount:
  Savings = 50,000
  Max = 3 × 50,000 = 150,000
  Rounded to nearest 5000 = 150,000
↓
System checks guarantor requirement:
  Loan amount 150,000 >= 5000
  → Requires 2 guarantors
↓
If all checks pass:
  Application proceeds
Else:
  Show error message
```

## Backward Compatibility

**Zero Breaking Changes:**
- All existing loans continue to work
- All existing repayments continue to work
- All existing transactions remain valid
- All existing chart of account mappings unchanged

**Migration Safety:**
- New tables only (no modification to existing tables except non-breaking additions)
- Nullable foreign keys in `transactions`
- Fallback to config if new account types not mapped

**Testing Strategy:**
- Run full existing test suite - all should pass
- Test existing loan approval flow
- Test existing repayment allocation
- Test existing interest accrual
